# Museum-Case-Study

I was thinking to solve a SQL case study since a long ago. So, finally I solved a case study from TechtfQ YouTube channel. It was about a painting museum. 

```Dataset Link:``` https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/famous-paintings

```Description:``` Famous paintings and their artists. This data set is published to help students have interesting data to practice SQL. This dataset contains 8 csv files namely image_link.csv, museum.csv, museum_hours.csv, product_size.csv, subject.csv, work.csv, artist.csv, canvas_size.csv.
